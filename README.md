# project_history
## Source code for existing and completed projects
#### Note: much of the work listed is covered under NDA by employer, and clients

# SKYNET/ARGUS (Python3/Python2)
Custom Neural Network engine
Post Disaster Needs Assesment Automation(PDNAA)
Tool kit for developing and testing detection algorithms tailored to image segmentation. This package can be used as a stand alone or with the tensorflow framework for more complex analysis.

# Overpass (Python3)
Tool for scanning open street map and preforming some analysis on the data.
The user will enter an extent using bounding box coordinates. A database is queried and returned data is used to provide analysis. The preferred database can be configured by the user.

# Game Mode (C)
Processing optimazation tool for gaming designed to be integrated with an elgato stream deck.
1st place winner @ 2019 IEEE Student Activities Conference Hackathon (SAC)
The tool scans a configurable whitelist for necessary software, anything not on the white list is terminated.

# Weaklink.AI (Python3/Java Script)
Stock trading for dummies will predict the volitility of a stock and present in visually appealing way
Princton Hacks top financial hack
Scans the current state of the market using yahoo's finance API, calculates the top preforming tickers based on their price to earning ratio (PE ratio). The front end displays the top preformers by sector and indicates the symbol's preformance relative to the 
market.

# BESPIN (Python3)
Cloud detection on overhead imagery. Machine Learning algorithm development for automatic target recognition using computer vision.

# Solar Pannel Detector (Python3)
Solar pannel detection on overhead imagery. Machine Learning algorithm development for automatic target recognition using computer vision.

# PLASMA (MATLAB)
Payload simulation analysis software
Custom MATLAB toolbox tailored to customer specification. Analysis package built for use by image scientist to preform optimal raytracing through an optical system.

# Data Slate (Python3/HTML/CSS/Java Script)
Full stack web application tailored for assay analysis

# CMPT-GEN (Python3)
Payload simulation analysis software
Originally developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, this is a radiance calculator given vehicle and geometric parameters modes tailored unique situations are identified and defined.

# Avro Deserializer (Python 3)
In house tool to deserialize meta data written in the avro protocol.

# Smart Home Controller (Kotlin)
Mobile application developed for android. Contained a custom UX design, users capture gestures with the smart phone camera. An algorithm was trained to recognise the gestures so the users can use the gestures to control smart devices through the smart home application.

# Pythonic Autonomous NIIRS Recognition (Python 3)
Algorithm development
Use computer vision on remote imagery joined with shallow learning to autonomously detect NIIRS rating of an image.

## For Fun

### PAC MAN (Python3)
Classic pac man with procedual maze generation.

### Tetris (Python3)
Classic tetris in pure python

### Cube Attack (C#)
Endless platformer

### Table Top Tipper (C#)
Asset package for unity containing demonstration level on interfacing with mobile devices.
